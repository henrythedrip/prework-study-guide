# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This is a notes location. My motivation in building this project was to provide a comprehensive location for coding bootcamp prework notes and information. We built it so that students could have an easier time looking for information. It helps students study and be in contact with impartial information about coding. I learned a lot about Git through making this program.
